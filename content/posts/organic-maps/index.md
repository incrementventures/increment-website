I was recently looking for an alternative to the excellent, but increasingly expensive Gaia app for outdoor mapping. I use Gaia a lot when hiking and mountain biking as it provides very nice outdoor specific maps (with topo lines etc) that you can download to your device for offline use. Recently they were bought by Outside and their pricing has gotten more and more agressive. While it seemed like a fair deal at $40/yr, the latest price increase has brought it to $90/yr, which feels rich considering they are using data from Open Street Maps.

Anyways, on the hunt for something Open Source I came across Organic Maps. While not quite as polished as Gaia, Organic Maps works entirely offline (always!) and is entirely free and Open Source.

The project began as a fork of the discontinued Maps.me open source version, which had drifted toward commercial use. A group of developers revived and rebuilt it under the name Organic Maps, with a mission to offer free, community-driven mapping tools for everyone. Since then, it has grown into a feature-rich app available on both Android and iOS.

Key features include offline turn-by-turn navigation, hiking and biking trails, offline search, bookmarks, and lightning-fast map rendering. Because it's based on OpenStreetMap, improvements made by the global OSM community are reflected in the app â€” and anyone can contribute.

For developers and contributors, the Organic Maps [GitHub repo](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps) is actively maintained. New contributors can jump in by checking out the list of [good first issues](https://github.com/organicmaps/organicmaps/labels/Good%20first%20issue). I've interacted with the team a few times and have had positive experiences. While it is a complicated codebase, their developers are responsive and helpful in getting you up to speed.
